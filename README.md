# Linear Regression

The project focuses on conducting regression analysis using the "dataArrests" dataset. It begins by providing an overview of the dataset. The analysis aims to understand the relationships between explanatory variables such as Assault, Urban Prop, Traffic, Car Accidents, and the dependent variable, Murder.

The exploration starts with univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis, shedding light on the characteristics and patterns within the data. This helps in gaining insights into the relationships between the explanatory and dependent variables.To prepare for building a linear regression model, the dataset undergoes pre-processing. This involves handling missing values, which is crucial to ensure the quality of the regression model. In this case, missing value rows are eliminated rather than imputed, given the relatively low count of missing values.

The project aims to construct a linear regression model to forecast the number of murders using the provided explanatory variables. Additionally, the analysis checks whether the linear regression model meets the five assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS).
Ultimately, the project's findings and results are expected to offer insights that can guide future resource allocation decisions by law enforcement.

# K-means Clustering

The project revolves around performing clustering analysis on the "wholesale" dataset. It commences by introducing the dataset, providing context and background information. Moreover, the exploratory data analysis phase highlights the exploration of variables within the dataset.

Prior to generating clusters, the dataset undergoes preprocessing and scaling. This prepares the data for clustering analysis by ensuring its quality and homogeneity. Scaling can be essential to ensure that variables are comparable and have equal influence on the clustering process.

In order to determine the optimal number of clusters, various methods are employed. These methods are used to guide the selection of the appropriate number of clusters before applying the K-Means clustering algorithm. Selecting the optimal number of clusters is a crucial step to ensure meaningful and interpretable results.

Ultimately, the analysis concludes with presenting findings and results that hold implications for the wholesale company's future decisions. The insights drawn from the clustering analysis are expected to assist the company in understanding patterns and structures within their data, aiding in making informed decisions.
